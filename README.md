___________________________________________


We're working a special project named Maxi OS. It's a simulated OS by html. We update everyday. We're always planning special releases. Click the button that says "websim.ai" and you can play games.
However, you may be asking why no files are updating in "OS.html" That's because we made the simulated OS with Canva website builder.
To use canva website builder, go to "canva.com". To embed your Canva site, press Share. Then, click Embed. Copy the HTML, not the smart link. Then paste the HTML in one of your GitHub respositories. Then, you have your Canva site, embedded on your GitHub page.
